                <h4>Compare and Despair!</h4>
                <p>Don't worry about what others are doing or where others are at.They have their own journey. 
                    Just focus on your journey. There is no rush to get anywhere.<br> Think about all those time you did rush
                    in the past and ended up waiting anyway. We all want our path to be a straight line up, and that's just not a real thing. 
                    Take a deep breath! You are doing great! Just take it step by step.</p><br>
